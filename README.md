## SBAB Home Assignment Project with following requirement
---
- The task is to implement an API for potential clients. 
- The API will have minimum 2 endpoints.
- One end-point should return the top 10 bus lines in Stockholm area with most bus stops on
their route. 
- The other endpoint should return a list of every bus stop of the bus line
provided. 
- There is no requirement on how the bus stops are sorted.
- To accomplish the task please use the Trafiklabâ€™s open API (https://www.trafiklab.se). You
can find more information about the specific API at the documentation page:
http://www.trafiklab.se/api/sl-hallplatser-och-linjer-2.
You can register your own account at Trafiklab and obtain an API key.
- The data should be automatically gathered from API for each run of the application.

### Solution Language & Framework choice
- Java 11
- Spring boot Project
- Maven 3+ for building project and running integration test
- Spring Data JPA for persistence layer
- H2 in memory database 
- Swagger 3 for Api Documentation 
- RestController for Apis
- Health Check endpoints  
- Cucumber framework for running Integration test 
---
### How to run, build & verify integration test 
- Build project & run integration test  $ `mvn clean install`
- Run the app with  $ `mvn spring-boot:run` then browse to http://localhost:8080
- To access Swagger for testing Apis then browse to http://localhost:8080/swagger
- When the app is running, the in-memory DB can be inspected at http://localhost:8080/h2-console 
  This is, of course, a proof of concept and should not be deployed publicly.
---
### Design considerations
- On application startup sl api endpoint are called and retrieves data.
- Data is stored in memory database
- N.W. read Timeout or Connection time out exception scenarios
  There is chance due to n.w. slowness or bad connectivity application might not be able to make call to sl api.
- In that case application will use cachedFile which is available on path  `src/test/resources/jour.json`
- Choice of H2 database is for simplicity of test, however just change property application can be configured to any other database.
- Sl api documentation says, they refresh data in every 24h, therefore data can be store in database for 24 hours and a scheduler can fatah fresh data in given intervals
